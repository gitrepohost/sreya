The Legacy Phase 1 by Silverglades – Ultra‑Luxury Landing Page Design

Project: The Legacy Phase 1 (by Silverglades) – Sector 63A, Gurgaon
Goal: Create a luxurious, high-conversion landing page for Shreyansh Jain Properties to showcase this premium residential project. The design will reflect ultra-luxury branding and prioritize lead generation with prominent calls-to-action (CTAs), an inquiry form, and persuasive copy.

Hero Section: First Impressions of Luxury

Hero concept: A stunning rendering of The Legacy’s towers rising above lush greenery, immediately conveying exclusivity and grandeur. A bold tagline like “The Epitome of Luxury on Gurgaon’s Finest Address” overlays the image, capturing attention. The Shreyansh Properties logo will appear atop (ensuring brand consistency), and a prominent “Enquire Now” button invites action.

The hero section uses a clean, elegant layout with neutral tones (cream/black) and sleek gold accents for a high-end feel. This palette creates an atmosphere of exclusivity and high value
mehnav.com
. A concise subheading can highlight Sector 63A near Golf Course Road (a prime location) and a one-line project USP (e.g. “Limited 3 & 4 BHK Residences on 10.5 Acres”). Crucially, the main CTA (“Book a Site Visit” or “Get Pricing”) is placed above the fold, standing out in a contrasting gold-accented button for immediate visibility
sliderrevolution.com
unbounce.com
. This section establishes a luxurious tone and drives the visitor toward the next step without scrolling.

Features in Hero:

Sticky Nav & Logo: The Shreyansh Jain Properties logo (top-left) and a minimal navigation bar (smooth-scrolling to sections like Highlights, Amenities, Floor Plans, Contact). The logo and nav stay fixed for easy access.

Headline & Tagline: Project name “The Legacy Phase 1” and tagline “The Epitome of Luxury on Gurgaon’s Finest Address” in elegant typography (e.g. a serif or thin sans-serif for a modern-classic look).

CTA Button: A prominent button styled in a gold or bronze tone (contrasting the neutral background) labeled “Enquire Now” or “Book a Site Visit”. This invites the user to take action immediately. (On click, it smooth-scrolls to the inquiry form.)

Quick Info Badges: Below the CTA or as an overlay, a few key badges: e.g. “RERA Registered” (with RERA ID), “Sector 63A, Gurgaon” (location), and “Ultra-Luxury 3 & 4 BHK” – small snippets that build trust and context at a glance. These act as trust signals upfront (since trust symbols on landing pages help reassure visitors
contempothemes.com
).

Rationale: The hero section’s luxurious visuals and clear CTA aim to hook the visitor within seconds. High-quality imagery and a bold headline immediately communicate the project’s exclusivity, while the visible CTA capitalizes on that interest to start capturing leads. Research shows that including striking visuals and a direct call-to-action above the fold improves engagement and conversion

Key Highlights at a Glance

After the hero, a Highlights section presents the project’s unique selling points in a concise, scannable format. This section uses a clean icon list or grid to showcase what sets The Legacy apart:

Low-Density Development: Sprawling 10.5-acre campus with only ~341 units in Phase 1 (≈40 units/acre – a first in luxury development)
scribd.com
. This means abundant open space and privacy.

4 + 1 Towers, G+35/36 Floors: Four main high-rise towers (plus one exclusive tower/block), each up to 35–36 storeys tall, offering panoramic views of Gurgaon’s skyline.

70–80% Open Greens: The site is mostly open space – landscaped gardens, lawns, and a 3.5-acre nature walk. Residents enjoy serenity and resort-like ambiance right at home.

Private Lift Lobbies: Each residence has a private or semi-private elevator lobby, enhancing privacy and the feel of exclusivity. No crowded corridors – a personal entrance for your home.

No EWS Units: The project is exclusively luxury, with no Economically Weaker Section units on site, preserving the elite community feel.

60m Wide Road Access: Located on a 60-meter wide arterial road for direct connectivity. Easy access ensures convenience, and the broad approach road befits the grand stature of the development.

These highlights are displayed with simple icons (e.g. a tree for open space, building icon for towers, elevator icon for private lift, map pin for location). Using a visual list lets users quickly absorb key facts. The design keeps text brief and impactful, ideal for scanning
contempothemes.com
. For example, the “10.5 Acres” item might show a tree/land icon and text “Low-density 10.5 acre estate – only 40 homes/acre!” to hammer the exclusivity point.

Conversion Note: Emphasizing unique features addresses buyer pain points and desires (privacy, space, prestige). Clear, benefit-oriented highlights (“Private lift = no waiting, only you and your guests”) connect emotionally with luxury buyers. This resonates with the target audience (high-end investors/families) and supports higher conversion rates
contempothemes.com
.

Ultra-Luxury Amenities & Lifestyle

Amenities concept: A glimpse of the resort-style clubhouse and pool, with tower architecture in the background. Two palm-fringed clubhouses and a shimmering pool promise a life of leisure. The design will use such imagery to let visitors virtually step into the luxury lifestyle on offer.

This section paints the picture of the lifestyle at The Legacy through both text and images. A short intro paragraph could read: “Experience a life of privilege with world-class amenities spread across The Legacy’s expansive campus.” Key amenities are then listed (possibly in a multi-column layout or carousel of images):

Forest Trail & Orchard Garden: A 3.5-acre Nature Walk weaves through lush forestry and themed gardens. Stroll under canopy of trees, relax in orchard gardens, or unwind in private cabanas amid nature
silverglades.com
. Every step is a retreat from the city’s bustle
silverglades.com
.

Club Primo (Luxury Clubhouse): One of two exclusive clubhouses, Club Primo offers a spa and sauna, state-of-the-art gym, infinity swimming pool, fine-dining restaurant & bar, and even a private banquet hall
scribd.com
scribd.com
. It’s like having a five-star resort within your home.

Family Recreation: From a kids’ play arena to indoor game rooms and a mini cinema, every age group is catered to. Outdoor sports include a tennis court, half basketball court, skating rink, and jogging/cycling tracks for a healthy lifestyle (all within gated security).

Concierge & Hospitality Services: Uniquely, The Legacy is designed in partnership with the Oberoi Hotels Group (EIH) for hospitality consulting
scribd.com
. Expect hotel-grade concierge service, valet, and personalized assistance – adding a layer of five-star service to daily life.

Green & Sustainable Living: The development integrates eco-friendly measures: rainwater harvesting, solar powering for common areas, and abundant planting. A “Green living boulevard” ensures sustainability without compromising luxury
scribd.com
. Plus, with 3-tier security (24/7 guarded access, CCTV, patrols), residents enjoy peace of mind
scribd.com
.

The design will incorporate a mix of text and visuals here. For example, alongside the bullet list (for SEO and quick info), a few high-quality images or an amenities photo gallery can scroll – showing the pool, landscaped gardens, club interior, etc. (The provided brochure images of the pool and green spaces will be used for authenticity.) Captions or hover labels on images can name the facility (e.g. “Resort Pool”, “Forest Trail”, “Clubhouse Lounge”).

UX Tip: This section can also use a subtle scroll animation or fade-in (e.g., icons appear one by one) to enhance the modern feel. The tone is expository yet aspirational – inviting the reader to “immerse in serenity as every moment gets enveloped by nature’s magic”
scribd.com
 (drawing from the project’s own poetic phrasing). By showcasing the amenities and lifestyle benefits, we’re appealing to the emotions, which is key for converting luxury real estate buyers
contempothemes.com
.

Residences & Floor Plans

This section highlights the residential offerings, floor plan options, and pricing info. A brief intro might say: “The Legacy Phase 1 offers expansive homes designed for elite living. Choose from 3 or 4 bedroom residences – each thoughtfully planned for space, privacy, and panoramic views.”

We then list the unit configurations available:

3 BHK + Utility (Family Lounge, Powder Room): 2800 sq.ft. super area. Starting at ₹6.58 Cr onwards. Spacious 3-bedroom apartments with an extra family lounge – perfect for intimate gatherings or a home theatre. Comes with a service room and powder room for guests.

4 BHK + Utility (Family Lounge, Powder Room): 3800 sq.ft. super area. Price available on request. These large 4-bedroom homes include a family lounge and service quarters. Enjoy a villa-like space in the sky, with private lift lobby access and at most one neighbor on your floor.

4 BHK + Study + Utility (Family Lounge & Powder): 4800 sq.ft. super area. (Limited units, including penthouse editions.) The ultimate in luxury, featuring 4 bedrooms + a dedicated study room and family lounge. Approximately ₹11 Cr+ (indicative) for these marquee residences (exact pricing on enquiry). Each of these occupies a prime corner, with expansive wrap-around balconies.

(The above text can be formatted as a 3-column comparison or an accordion where each unit type expands for details.)

For visual impact, this section can include floor plan thumbnails or a link to view/download floor plans. For example, a neat floor plan image for each type can be shown with a “View Plan” button that opens a full-size plan or PDF. The layout will ensure these images are clear on desktop, while on mobile perhaps a slider for plans.

We will also emphasize the luxurious interior specs in brief: Italian marble flooring, engineered wood in bedrooms, smart home automation, VRV air conditioning, premium bath fittings (Kohler/Grohe) – all the hallmarks of an ultra-premium home
scribd.com
scribd.com
. A short bullet list or icons (e.g. a marble icon, a smart-home icon) can convey this: “Italian marble flooring, Home Automation, Floor-to-ceiling windows,” etc. This reassures buyers of the high quality without needing to read a separate spec sheet.

Trust Signals: Right alongside the pricing or floor plan info, we reinforce credibility: display the HARERA RERA Registration No. RC/REP/HARERA/GGM/861/593/2024/88 prominently
scribd.com
 (maybe as a badge or footnote) and mention “RERA Registered & Approved”. Also mention “Developed by Silverglades (Renowned Luxury Developer)” near the unit info – leveraging the builder’s brand as a trust factor. These elements increase buyer confidence in the project’s legitimacy and quality.

Design notes: A light background (off-white) with gold-accented headings will keep this section airy. Key numbers (sq.ft., price) can be in a larger or contrasting font for quick browsing. The “Enquire Now” CTA appears again here – e.g. after listing the units, a centered banner “Schedule a Private Tour of the Show Residence” with a button. Keeping one clear CTA repeated, rather than multiple different ones, maintains focus
unbounce.com
.

Video Walkthrough

To further engage visitors, the page will include an embedded YouTube video tour of The Legacy. This could be placed after the static content sections, with a full-width video player (16:9 ratio) that is responsive on all devices. The provided video link will be embedded (e.g., via an iframe) and titled “Walkthrough: The Legacy by Silverglades – Experience the Lifestyle”.

Video Section Layout: A dark overlay background (to make it cinematic) with the video in center. A short intro text above the video could say: “🎥 Take a Virtual Tour – Get a glimpse of the ultra-luxurious apartments and amenities through our exclusive video walkthrough.” The video thumbnail should be an appealing shot (e.g. a living room or aerial view of towers at sunset) to entice clicks.

Why Video? Including a video tour can dramatically increase visitor engagement and lead conversion. High-quality visuals like videos and virtual tours can boost inquiries by up to 403%
contempothemes.com
. It allows potential buyers to feel the space and quality, making them more likely to submit an inquiry after being emotionally impressed. Moreover, modern real estate shoppers expect interactive content – nearly 80% prefer agents or projects that offer virtual tours
mehnav.com
.

The video will have a clear play button and fallback text for SEO (describing the content of the video for those who can’t play it). We ensure it’s not auto-play (so as not to annoy users or consume data on mobile). Instead, the user chooses to play – which implies a higher intent when they do. After the video, another CTA button or even an inline form could appear: e.g., “Loved what you saw? Book a site visit to experience it in person.”

Testimonials & Social Proof

To bolster credibility, we include a Testimonials section. This will feature one or two testimonials from either previous buyers of Silverglades properties or experts in the real estate industry speaking to Silverglades’ quality (since The Legacy Phase 1 itself is newly launched). For example:

“Investing in a Silverglades home was the best decision – the quality and luxury are unparalleled. The Legacy promises the same excellence, if not more.” – A. Gupta, Owner at Silverglades’ Aralia Residences.

“The Legacy truly raises the bar for luxury living in Gurgaon. The attention to detail in design and the array of amenities rival five-star resorts.” – RealtyPlus Magazine, Project Preview.

Each testimonial is displayed in a stylish quote card, possibly with a small profile photo or logo (if from a publication). The design will keep it simple and sincere: italic text for the quote, bold for the name, maybe a subtle gold quotation mark graphic for flair.

Including testimonials (social proof) can boost conversions significantly, as visitors see real people vouching for the project
contempothemes.com
. Even if brief, they help establish trust. Where possible, we include specifics in the testimonial (e.g., mentioning a feature: “private lift lobby” or “nature walk”) to make them more concrete and believable.

Additionally, we can add a small logo strip of partners or certifications underneath – e.g., “Architecture by XYZ Architects”, “Hospitality Consultant: Oberoi Group”, and “RERA Registered (ID: 88 of 2024)”. Even the mention of the Oberoi partnership is a strong trust signal (association with a famous luxury hotel brand adds prestige). Logos of banks for home loans or awards (if any) could be added here too. These elements serve as visual social proof, which is processed quickly by visitors

.

Location & Neighborhood

Location Map: The Legacy at Sector 63A in Gurgaon’s prime Golf Course Extension area. This stylized map highlights the project’s location (marked with the Legacy logo) and nearby landmarks like Golf Course Road, metro stations, schools, hospitals, and the IGI Airport.

Location is a huge selling point, so this section emphasizes “Gurgaon’s Finest Address”. We will show a simplified map of the project’s vicinity – either a custom illustrated map (as in the brochure, highlighting major roads: Golf Course Extension Road, nearby Golf Course Road, Sohna Road, etc.) or embed a Google Map for interactivity. Given the design preference for luxury, a custom dark-themed map (as provided) aligns well with the aesthetic, whereas a Google Map embed could be used in a pinch for functionality (with a marker on The Legacy).

Content: A short paragraph or two describing the enviable location: e.g., “Nestled in Sector 63A just off Golf Course Road, The Legacy offers unmatched connectivity and prestige. You’re minutes from top business hubs, golf clubs, luxury hotels, and the upcoming metro line. Despite its central location, the 10.5-acre estate is tucked away from noise – offering a serene sanctuary amid the city.” We can list a few key distances in a small grid or list for quick info, for instance:

5 min to Golf Course Road

10 min to Rapid Metro / Upcoming Metro Station

20 min to Cyber City / Galleria Market

30 min to IGI Airport (via NH8)

And so on, focusing on how accessible yet exclusive the area is. A line could mention: “Surrounded by high-end developments and a well-established social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, shopping malls), Sector 63A is Gurgaon’s new magnet for luxury home seekers.”

The map image (as embedded above) reinforces these points visually, showing The Legacy’s position relative to major landmarks. The black-and-gold map aesthetic also ties into the overall color scheme, maintaining the premium look.

Contact & Lead Capture

Finally, the page concludes with a dedicated Contact / Inquiry section – the conversion powerhouse of the page. This section will have a compelling call-to-action, a form, and contact details/trust info. It will be designed to stand out (perhaps with a contrasting background – e.g., a dark charcoal with gold text, or a rich image backdrop with a semi-transparent overlay, ensuring the form is clear).

Lead Capture Form:
A simple, embedded inquiry form invites the visitor to leave their details. It includes only the essential fields to minimize friction
contempothemes.com
:

Name (text)

Contact (Phone or Email)

Inquiry Type (dropdown: e.g., Site Visit, Price Details, Other)

Message (textarea for any specific query)

The form design will be clean and mobile-friendly: large input fields (easy to tap on phones)
mehnav.com
, clear labels inside or above each field, and no clutter. A subtle privacy note or trust badge under the form (e.g., “Your info is safe with us – we’ll only use it to contact you about The Legacy”). The submit button should be prominently styled (likely again a gold button with a text like “Submit Inquiry” or “Request Call Back”).

We will also place a secondary CTA button like “📞  Call Now: 98xxx 44999” for those who prefer direct contact, and possibly a WhatsApp chat link – as many high-end clients appreciate instant contact. These could be small but visible (using icons for phone/WhatsApp).

Trust and Credentials (in Contact section): To reinforce trust at the point of conversion, we display the project’s credentials here as well. For example, a line reading *“HARERA Registration No: RC/REP/HARERA/GGM/861/593/2024/88
scribd.com
 – The Legacy Phase 1 is a fully RERA-compliant project.” This assures the lead that this is a legitimate offering (important for real estate in India). Also mention “Exclusive Channel Partner: Shreyansh Jain Properties”, positioning the site as an authorized seller. The Shreyansh Properties logo can appear here again (if not in header, definitely here in footer) alongside the Silverglades logo, to leverage both brand reputations.

We also include the office contact info of Shreyansh Properties (address, email, phone) and working hours, perhaps in a column next to the form, so users know there are real people behind the site. A small map thumbnail or link “View Location” could be here if the user wants to see the Shreyansh office or project site on Google Maps.

Finally, the footer will note: “© 2025 Shreyansh Jain Properties. All Rights Reserved.” and perhaps quick links or disclaimer (e.g., "Prices and availability subject to change. Terms & conditions apply.").

Conversion Consideration: By placing the form at the end, after we’ve built up the project’s desirability, we catch the user when they’ve absorbed all the info. However, we also keep a CTA button persistent (in header or as a small sticky at bottom on mobile, like “Enquire”) so they can jump to the form anytime. The form’s simplicity encourages submissions – more fields can deter users, so we keep it minimal
contempothemes.com
. Also, highlighting the RERA registration and using the word “Secure/Private” near the form can increase trust, nudging the hesitant user to convert
contempothemes.com
.

Design Style & Responsiveness

The overall look is clean, modern, and opulent. Key design choices include:

Color Scheme: A neutral base (white or champagne) with gold/bronze accents for buttons and headings. Black or charcoal text for high contrast. This palette exudes luxury when done subtly
sliderrevolution.com
. Gold is used sparingly (for CTAs, icons, separators) to avoid overwhelming the design
sliderrevolution.com
, maintaining elegance.

Typography: Use of a sophisticated font pairing – perhaps a serif font for headings (to signal classic luxury) and a sans-serif font for body text (for modern readability). All text is high-contrast for readability (WCAG accessible). Headings might use slight stylistic flourishes (small caps or letter spacing) to mimic the upscale branding seen in the brochure.

Imagery: High-resolution images provided (renders of the towers, amenity photos, etc.) are placed strategically: a large hero image, smaller supporting images in amenities and possibly a background image in the contact section. All images will be optimized (compressed and in next-gen formats like WebP) for fast loading – essential since image-heavy pages can be slow and 40% of users drop off if load >3s
mehnav.com
. We’ll implement techniques like lazy loading for images further down the page to ensure the initial load is swift
mehnav.com
.

Layout: A sectioned one-page layout with clear delineation (perhaps alternating light and dark section backgrounds to create contrast between sections). Plenty of whitespace will be used to give an airy, uncluttered feel – a hallmark of luxury design. Content is center-aligned or in balanced grid layouts, avoiding anything that looks too busy. Each section is introduced by a succinct heading for easy scanning.

Interactive Elements: Smooth scroll for nav links, and slight animations (like fade-ins, parallax on the hero image text, or hover effects on buttons) to give a polished, modern feel. However, animations will be kept subtle to ensure it still loads fast and runs well on mobile devices.

Responsive Design: The page will be fully mobile responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. On mobile, elements stack vertically and images resize to full-width. The CTA buttons become easily tappable (full-width buttons if needed). The navigation likely collapses into a hamburger menu. Given that over 60% of real estate site visits come from mobile
mehnav.com
, we ensure text remains readable (no tiny fonts), and interactive elements (forms, buttons) are easy to use on touch screens
mehnav.com
. Testing on various devices will ensure the luxury experience translates to mobile as well.

Conclusion

This landing page is designed to captivate high-end homebuyers with its luxurious aesthetic and persuasive content, while strategically driving them to convert into leads. Every element from the hero image to the contact form has a purpose: either to build desire for The Legacy’s lifestyle or to build trust and facilitate action. By blending elegant design with conversion best practices – prominent CTAs, social proof, limited-form fields, mobile optimization – this page will not only impress visitors but also effectively turn them into inquiries and site visits
contempothemes.com
contempothemes.com
.

All the above components come together as a production-ready HTML/CSS design (or equivalent high-fidelity Figma layout) that Shreyansh Jain Properties can integrate into their website. The result will be a smooth-scrolling, visually stunning, and conversion-optimized landing page that befits The Legacy’s ultra-luxury status and maximizes lead generation for the project.
